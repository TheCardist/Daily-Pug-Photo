# Daily-Pug-Photo
As a lover of pugs, I wanted to start my day by seeing a cute pug before work.

## Solution
This project uses the Reddit API to look at the pug's subreddit and pull down a random pug each day. It then emails a link to the photo or a text via the Twilio API. It is easily expanded to multiple emails or phone numbers using a txt file.
